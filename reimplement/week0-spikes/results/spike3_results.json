  "detailed_results": "## ODS Library Parsing Results\n\n### Status: ✗ NOT VIABLE (fallback to custom)\n\n### Issues Identified\n- Library parsing unstable or has fundamental limitations\n- Error collection not feasible with current design\n- Performance unacceptable for hospital use case (\u003e1s for 5000 cells)\n\n### Scope of Custom Implementation\n- ZIP archive handling (ODS is ZIP-based XML)\n- XML parsing with error recovery\n- Cell extraction and type preservation\n- Error accumulation and reporting\n- Integration testing\n\n### Timeline Cost\n- Phase 0: +1 week (custom reader development)\n- Phase 1: +2 weeks (integration, testing)\n- **Total: +3 weeks to Phase 2 schedule**\n\n### Risk Factors\n- Custom parsing prone to edge cases\n- Needs comprehensive testing with real hospital ODS files\n- Maintenance burden on team\n\n### Recommendation\nAVOID custom implementation if any library is viable.\nOnly proceed if library testing reveals blocking issues.\n"
